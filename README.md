# AQI_Prediction 
WID3014 Practical A.I

### Overview
```
AQI (Air Quality Index) prediction involves forecasting the air quality levels in a specific area by analyzing environmental factors such as pollutant concentrations
(e.g., PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, SO2, and O3), weather conditions, and historical AQI data. The goal of our project is to estimate future air quality to help governments, organizations,
and individuals take proactive measures to mitigate health risks and improve environmental conditions. Advanced technologies
 like machine learning and statistical models are used here for accurate AQI predictions.
