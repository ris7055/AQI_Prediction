# AQI_Prediction 
WID3014 Practical A.I

### Overview
```
Air pollution is a pressing environmental and health challenge, with pollutants like carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), ozone (O₃), particulate matter (PM 10, PM 2.5), and sulfur dioxide (SO₂)
significantly impacting public health. The Air Quality Index (AQI) serves as a critical measure to assess air quality and its potential health effects. In this project,
the objective is to predict the AQI using historical data on individual pollutant concentrations. This allows stakeholders to anticipate poor air quality and take preventive measures to mitigate health risks.
However, unlike the initial project proposal, the dataset used in this study does not include region-specific information. Instead, it focuses on temporal
pollutant concentration levels, which necessitated a shift from region-based predictions to pollutant-driven AQI forecasting. The project aims to develop a machine learning-based model to analyze and predict AQI trends effectively.
